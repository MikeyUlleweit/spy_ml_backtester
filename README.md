# SPY Directional ML Backtester (Python + xboost + C++)

This project builds a machine learning pipeline to predict the directional movement of the SPY ETF using technical indicators. A custom C++ backtester simulates execution logic and strategy performance based on the modelâ€™s predictions.

---

## Overview

- **Model**: XGBoost classifier using MACD and RSI features  
- **Objective**: Predict whether SPY will go up or down the next day  
- **Threshold Logic**: Long if confidence > 60%, short if < 40%, or if MACD & RSI > 0.5  
- **Backtester**: Custom C++ engine that handles position sizing and risk-limited profit  
- **Visualization**: Python script to generate and annotate equity curve

---

## Tech Stack

- **Python**: `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `scikit-learn`, `xgboost`, `yfinance`  
- **C++**: Custom logic for backtesting, risk management, trade tracking  
- **CSV**: Model predictions exported from Python â†’ consumed by C++

| Metric         | Value        |
|----------------|--------------|
| Initial Equity | $10,000.00   |
